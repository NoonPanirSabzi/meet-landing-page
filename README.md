### üß† What I Learned

Lots of valuable lessons! Here are the key ones:

1. **`100vw` includes the scrollbar in most browsers**  
   This can lead to layout shifts and headaches when aiming for pixel-perfect designs.  
   **Solution:** Prefer using `100%` or other layout strategies that don‚Äôt include the scrollbar width.

2. **Negative margins can pull elements in any direction**  
   Handy for overlapping or fine-tuning layout positioning.

3. **The CSS `transform` property**  
   Still working on mastering it.

4. **Positioning absolutely inside a relatively positioned container**  
   The theory made more sense once I used it in action.

5. **Centering an absolutely positioned element**  
   Shift the element 50% from the left of the container, then pull it back 50% of its own width:

   ```css
   .container {
     position: relative;
   }

   .child {
     position: absolute;
     left: 50%; /* this is 50% of the container width*/
     transform: translateX(-50%); /* this is 50% of the element width*/
   }
   ```

   üü∞ Ta-da! Centered horizontally!  
   you can apply the same logic to the Y-axis for vertical centering.

6. **`z-index` only works on positioned elements**  
   That means `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`. It‚Äôs ignored if the element is `static`.

7. **Combining background image and color requires a `linear-gradient()`**  
   The color layer has to be a gradient‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just one color. otherwise it won't work ‚òπÔ∏è

   ```css
   .element {
     background: linear-gradient(
         rgba(77, 150, 169, 0.8955),
         rgba(77, 150, 169, 0.8955)
       ), url("path/to/image.jpeg") center/cover no-repeat;
   }
   ```

8. **Flexbox vs. Grid**  
   If you need a managable two-dimensional layout, don't make my mistake of trying to build it with Flexbox  
   go with Grid from the beginning.
